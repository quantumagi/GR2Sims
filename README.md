# Gravity Simulations in 4D

Python code for simulating gravitational dynamics within a novel scalar-field-based theory of gravity.

## Overview

This repository contains simulations supporting the key results presented in the paper:

1. **N-Body Simulation in 4D**  
   Demonstrates how particle dynamics arise from the scalar phase field's gradient flow, with emergent gravitational interactions encoded in the effective potential. Based on the hydrodynamic interpretation of the field equations.  

2. **Mercuryâ€™s Perihelion Precession**  
   Reproduces the observed anomalous perihelion advance of Mercury by including relativistic corrections derived from the emergent metric structure in the scalar theory.

3. **Pantheon Supernova Data Fit**  
   Fits observational supernova data to the cosmological solution derived from the scalar theory's phase expansion.
